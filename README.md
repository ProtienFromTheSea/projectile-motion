# projectile-motion
A glitchy science fair project, made to simulate basic projectile motion equations in c#.\
Please read the license as well as this.\
This project was made for my science fair in Visual Studio 2019 C#. It hase some bugs, don't expect it to work perfectly.

A few notes about the files:

1.) The layout of the files is the exact same as the way that Visual Studio creates them.\
1.1) This means that you can use it directly in Visual Studio for Windows.\
1.1.1) Also, Visual Studio is the best way to veiw these files.

2.) Because I am new to Git and it makes no sense to me, there is no gitignore file since it messed up my files.\
(Consequently, this project contains a load of unnecessary stuff.)

3.) There are some bitmap images of arrows in the resources, this is because I originally wanted to use them to preview the starting angles.\
(Since I couldn't figure it out, I now use the drawline method, but that doesn't work perfectly. Feel free to fix it to use the arrows and share it with me.)

Also check out my poster. (It's a PDF. Make sure to keep seperate from the actual project files)
